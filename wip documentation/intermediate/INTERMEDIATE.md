## Workshop Structure

Each exercise follows a structured pattern:
1. Complex type challenges
2. Real-world implementation scenarios
3. Testing and validation
4. Best practices and patterns

## Exercise Format

```typescript
// Example structure in each exercise:

// Advanced type manipulation
type DeepReadonly<T> = {
    readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] extends object ? DeepReadonly<T[P]> : T[P];
};

// Complex generic constraints
class TypeSafeAPI<T extends Record<string, unknown>> {
    // Implementation
}

// Decorator patterns
function Validate<T>() {
    return function (target: any, propertyKey: string) {
        // Implementation
    };
}
```

## Getting Started

1. Complete the beginner workshop first
2. Each exercise builds on previous concepts
3. Focus on understanding type relationships
4. Practice with real-world scenarios
5. Implement and test solutions

## Tips for Participants

- Use TypeScript Playground for experimentation
- Read TypeScript documentation thoroughly
- Practice type manipulation
- Understand type inference
- Focus on practical applications

## Learning Path

The exercises progress through increasingly complex concepts:

1. Advanced type system features
2. Generic patterns and constraints
3. Decorators and metadata
4. Pattern matching and events
5. State management
6. Async patterns
7. Module systems
8. Testing patterns

## Success Criteria

For each exercise, participants should:
